AVR-GPS-Logger

This project is about a simple GPS information display using an ATmega168 microcontroller.

It receives GPS data through the UART from a Holux GPS receiver. The NMEA parser extracts
location information, speed, heading and altitude (nmea.c).
The display is a DOGM163 connected in 8Bit parallel mode.

Additionally there is support for reading the ambient temperature and humidity
from a HYT321 via I2C interface (hyt.c). There is also code to calculate the dew point.

I planned to write the information to a SD-Card through the SPI, using some code
from Roland Riegel (sd_raw.c), but that is not implemented yet...

There is also a file fram.c, which could be used to write data to a FM25L256 serial memory, but I never
used or tested that either.

The EEPROM and UART code in GPS_Logger.c is taken from Atmel AppNotes.

The project is created with AVR-Studio 4 (just for programming the AVR), and I use eclipse
and WinAVR-20100110 to edit and compile it.
The circuit board is created with Target3001!, and included just for reference. Feel free to create your own.

Almost all comments are in german, well, because I'm german and I created this project for myself.
But I recently got the idea, I could share it, and so I did :-)
